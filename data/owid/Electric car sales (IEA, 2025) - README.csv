Getting data into Google Sheets,,,
"It's a good practice to copy your raw data into raw_data sheet and reference them with formula from data sheet. That way you get to keep the original data and have can apply any formulas or corrections in data. If your data doesn't need any Excel processing, it's fine to remove raw_data sheet and only keep data.",,,

Minimal dataset,,,
"If you have data that you want to visualise without polishing it and filling all metadata, then the following is mandatory:",,,
"1. Columns year and country in data sheet, other variables can have arbitrary names (order doesn't matter)",,,
"2. Filled title, short_name in dataset_meta sheet",,,
3. variables_meta and sources_meta can stay empty,,,
